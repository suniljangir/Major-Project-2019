India, one of the worldâ€™s largest food producers, is trying to tackle waste during production, 
processing, retailing and consumption by funding internal initiatives and by partnerships on best practice and technology 
with overseas investors. According to the FCI (Food Corporation of India), one of the key reason for food waste is damage
caused by investing in building new cold storage facilities over the next five years.

The project aims at providing a helping hand to the farmers and FCI officials by informing them about the future rainfall 
patterns around the area and the nearest safe house where the grains can be transported in order to avoid their wastage.

This project involves the below mentioned modules, all inside a single android application:
- Notifying farmers and officials if there are any chances of rainfall in the next 7 days.
- Directing officials to nearest safe depot with available storage capacity for grain transfer.
- Collecting feedback/complaint from users about grain wastage locations.
- Effect of current weather on different crops.
- Multi-language (English and Hindi) support for the users.
